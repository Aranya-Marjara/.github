## 🌳 About the Organization

**Aranya-Marjara** (Sanskrit: *Wild Cat*) is a **open-source organization** —  
currently maintained by a single **self-taught developer** — exploring how technology can be  
as **ethical, adaptive, and harmonious** as nature itself.

This organization focuses on creating transparent, research-driven software,  
mainly in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence** and, in the future, **Cybersecurity**.  
Every project here is built with respect for **freedom, privacy, learning** and the projects are intended purely for **educational** or **research purposes**, not for **commercial use** or **competition**.
---

## 🏹 Our Core Beliefs

- **Ethical by Design** — open, transparent, and non-commercial  
- **Silent Execution** — code that works beautifully without noise  
- **Adaptive Architecture** — systems that evolve like living organisms  
- **Knowledge as a Forest** — shared freely to grow and thrive  
- **Security as Respect** — we follow best-effort security practices to protect user data and privacy.
