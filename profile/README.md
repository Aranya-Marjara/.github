## 🌳 About the Collective

**Aranya-Marjara** (Sanskrit: *Forest Cat*) is a **non-profit open-source collective** —  
currently maintained by a single developer — exploring how technology can be  
as **ethical, adaptive, and harmonious** as nature itself.

This organization focuses on creating transparent, research-driven software,  
mainly in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cybersecurity** (coming soon).  
Every project here is built with respect for **freedom, privacy, and learning**.

## 🏹 Our Core Beliefs

- **Ethical by Design** — open, transparent, and non-commercial  
- **Silent Execution** — code that works beautifully without noise  
- **Adaptive Architecture** — systems evolving like living organisms  
- **Knowledge as a Forest** — shared freely to grow and thrive  
- **Security as Respect** — protecting users and their data
