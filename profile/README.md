## 🌳 About Our Tribe

**Aranya-Marjara** (Sanskrit: *Forest Cat*) is a collective of developers, designers, and digital craftsmen who believe in building software that is:

- **Elegant & Efficient** — like a predator’s movement through the jungle  
- **Sustainable & Scalable** — as resilient as a forest ecosystem  
- **Intuitive & Native** — feeling as natural as the wilderness itself  

We operate at the intersection of technology and nature, creating tools that serve both digital and environmental harmony.

## 🏹 Our Core Beliefs

- **Silent Execution** — code should work beautifully without unnecessary noise  
- **Adaptive Architecture** — systems should evolve like natural organisms  
- **Community as Ecosystem** — every contributor enriches our digital forest  
- **Open Source as Natural Law** — knowledge, like nature, should be free to grow
