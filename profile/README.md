# 🐾 Aranya-Marjara  

Aranya-Marjara, named after the Sanskrit term for “wild cat”, is an open-source organization focused on **understanding**, **experimenting with**, and **building** the core ideas behind modern AI and ML systems.

This organization is maintained by a single independent, self-taught developer and exists with one purpose:  
to create **clear, well-documented, learning-focused** implementations of foundational AI concepts — without hype or exaggeration.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All repositories are experimental and intended for learning, research, and personal exploration.  
No formal security audits have been conducted.  
Use responsibly and evaluate code before applying it in real-world systems.
