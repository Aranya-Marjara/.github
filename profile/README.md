# 🐾 Aranya-Marjara  
### Open-Source AI • Research • Tooling

Aranya-Marjara is an open-source organization focused on building transparent, educational, and research-driven software in **Artificial Intelligence**, **ML systems**, and future **Cybersecurity** tooling.

Maintained by a single developer, the goal is to create clear, well-documented projects that help others learn how real systems work under the hood.

---

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- **AI Systems** — model training, inference pipelines, research tooling  
- **ML Architectures** — transformers, attention mechanisms, custom layers  
- **Vision Systems** — perception pipelines, transformations, computer vision models  
- **Automation** — data pipelines, lightweight orchestration  
- **Cybersecurity (future)** — ethical tools for learning and analysis

## 🛠️ Projects

| Project | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [ScoutAgent](https://github.com/Aranya-Marjara/ScoutAgent) | 🟢 Active | Autonomous news & research intelligence agent |
| [mini-transformer-lab](https://github.com/Aranya-Marjara/mini-transformer-lab) | 🟢 Active | Compact transformer model built from scratch in PyTorch to study LLM internals |
| [VanaSight](https://github.com/Aranya-Marjara/vanasight) | 🟢 Active | Full computer-vision pipeline from image → processing → model perception |

More projects will be added gradually as the organization grows.

## 📐 Principles

- **Open Source First** — public, auditable, forkable  
- **Educational Purpose** — focused on learning & research  
- **Transparent Architecture** — code that explains itself  
- **Security-Aware** — best-effort practices; not production-certified  
- **Non-Commercial** — no monetization or competitive intent

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All repositories are experimental and intended for learning, research, and personal exploration.  
No formal security audits have been conducted.  
Use responsibly and evaluate code before applying it in real-world systems.
